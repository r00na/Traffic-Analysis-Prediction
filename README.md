# Traffic Data Analysis 🚦🚗📊

## Overview

This project processes and analyzes a traffic dataset to extract insights about vehicle counts, traffic conditions, and temporal trends. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, outlier detection, and visualization.

## Requirements ⚙️

The script requires the following Python libraries:

* `pandas` 
* `numpy` 
* `matplotlib` 
* `seaborn` 
* `sklearn.preprocessing` 🛠

## Data Processing 🔍

1. **Loading Data**: Reads the `traffic.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, converts data types, and removes duplicates. 🧹
3. **Feature Engineering**:

   * Extracts hour and minute from the `Time` column ⏰
   * Extracts day, month, year, and weekday from the `Date` column 
   * Converts numerical columns and handles negative values ↔
4. **Outlier Detection & Handling**:

   * Uses boxplots and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and remove outliers 
   * Applies transformations (log, square root) to handle skewness 
5. **Encoding**: Uses Label Encoding for categorical columns

## Visualizations 📊

* Boxplots and histograms to analyze vehicle count distributions 🚗🛵🚌🚚
* Bar and pie charts for traffic situation distribution 🚦
* Scatter plots and bar plots to analyze relationships between vehicle counts and traffic situations 📈
* Heatmaps to visualize traffic trends across hours and days 🔥

## Usage ▶️

Run the script in a Python environment:

```bash
python untitled77.py
```
